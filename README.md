# eventscalendar

Events Calendar for OS Commerce: This was created for a 2009 version and may no longer work.

This Project has moved to : https://bitbucket.org/matthewlinton/osc_eventscalendar

## About

Events Calendar allows you to add items to your catalog that will expire at a 
specific date and time.

This is a fork of Expired Products 1.3c(http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/6980).
Events Calendar is geared more towards setting up events and is much more
flexable for that purpose. If you are using Expired Products to add events to
your catalog, it is highly recomended that you switch over to Events Calendar
as Expired Products will no longer be actively maintained.

## Install

* Checkout: git clone https://github.com/matthewlinton/eventscalendar

* Read the instructions in 'events_calendar.txt'
